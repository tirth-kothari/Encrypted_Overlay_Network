Run the following command

```sh
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server_key.key -x509 -days 365 -out server_certificate.pem
```

This will generate a self signed certificate.

The common name should be the server's IP, other information is not necessary.

We can validate the information using the following command 

```sh
openssl x509 -text -noout -in server_certificate.pem
```


After a quick google we can do this all in one step
``` sh
$ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -subj "/C=US/L=Lowell/CN=student5.c6610.uml.edu" -keyout server_key.key -out server_certificate.pem
```


## Note
Cert with Common Name = "127.0.0.1" did not work, localhost did
